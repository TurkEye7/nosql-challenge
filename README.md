# NoSQL Challenge

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the usage of NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB, to analyze and update a collection of food hygiene ratings for establishments in the UK. The challenge was divided into three main parts:
1. **Database Setup and Jupyter Notebook**: Setting up the MongoDB database and interacting with it using Python.
2. **Database Updates**: Modifying the data in MongoDB by inserting, updating, and deleting documents.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Using MongoDB queries to answer questions based on the hygiene ratings data.

## Files
- **NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb**: This notebook handles the setup of the MongoDB database, including inserting the initial dataset, performing some basic queries, and making changes to the dataset.
- **NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb**: This notebook contains the exploratory analysis of the dataset, answering questions such as finding establishments with a specific hygiene score, and identifying the top-rated establishments near a specific location.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- PyMongo (Python MongoDB driver)
- Pandas (for data analysis)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Instructions
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` notebook to set up the MongoDB database.
4. Run the `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb` notebook to perform the exploratory data analysis.
